I could not use my mouse to aim (as the keybindings would suggest I should). Aim was fixed in place and all I could do was turn my little submarine. That changed after I bought one of the torpedo upgrades - I started to be able to aim with my mouse. I'm not sure if it's a bug or by design.

I rarely felt that I have wasted the \"expedition of the day\", usually returning with either a clear objective (having spotted an upgrade in the distance), or a clear idea of new paths to pursue the next time.\n\nSpeaking of the items, I felt that their placement and effect was effective as well, serving as direct goals and rewards for exploring a specific set of paths. Both the \"get rid of new kinds of obstacles\" and \"increase travel range\" bonuses felt meaningful, in the sense that they gave a feeling of actual progress and enabling of future explorations.\n\nThe skill-progression felt well balanced, with plenty of opportunities to improve either skill as needed. Although it took me some time to realize that you could actually dodge in combat (in effect, trading the more bountiful energy stat to save precious health). The steady amount of \"walking-XP\" at the same time meant that the time never felt completely wasted, even when ending up in a dead end.\n\n\nPresentation-wise, I really enjoyed the graphics, and the background tune was nice as well. The UI elements were clear and informative, with the only exception I notice being not being informed in all cases that boulders required a pickaxe to pass.\n\nGreat work! :-)","love":4,"love-timestamp":"2020-10-14T07:04:34Z","timestamp":"2020-10-5 21:14:35","ago":"10 months ago"},{"id":553822,"parent":0,"node":220269,"supernode":212256,"author":220596,"created":"2020-10-05T20:53:27Z","modified":"2020-10-05T20:53:27Z","version":612298,"flags":0,"body":"Cool idea, and I like the fact that you make progress just by walking.

The only usability problem that bugged me was that I had to press 'P' before 'R' to restart! Other than that, it's really the graphics that need the most improvement and I'm a terrible artist.

Turning is way too slow and there is not enough friction. It's difficult enough to drive down a straight road; making a turn without veering off into the grass is basically impossible.\n\nI got through the first two levels with barely enough time left on the clock, but the third seemed like I had to know the map well to actually beat it, since there's branching paths that aren't all visible on the minimap.\n\nI really like the transition animation between the driving and the shooting.\n\nShooting didn't have much weight to it, I just had to locate and click on all the enemies. I wonder if a little bit of kickback on the player camera, or a more visceral death animation would help this section.\n\nI think the driving music was a bit too aggressive and sine-y and grated on me a little after a few levels. The shooting music tones down the frustrating bits so I enjoyed that a lot more. Oh, and it's rare to see a LD game with multiple music tracks so nice work there, and with the transition.\n\nOverall, this game feels like it just needed a lot more love put into its core mechanics (the driving and shooting models), maybe at the cost of the maps and objectives being less fleshed-out, or fewer levels. I know I've made the same mistake myself sometimes, prioritizing content without a good baseline mechanic. Maybe keep that in mind next LD.","love":1,"love-timestamp":"2018-05-12T04:26:53Z","timestamp":"2018-5-11 22:51:35","ago":"3 years ago"}],"cover":"ludum-dare/41/drive-or-die/images/10313.png","timestamp":"2018-4-22 22:33:34","ago":"3 years ago","event":{"id":73256,"parent":9,"superparent":5,"author":11,"type":"event","subtype":"ld","subsubtype":"","published":"2018-03-15T01:50:26Z","created":"2018-03-15T01:50:26Z","modified":"2018-04-19T16:41:16Z","version":226293,"slug":"41","name":"Ludum Dare 41","body":"Join us for the **41st** Ludum Dare!

It reminds me of [Asteroid Scavenger](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/asteroid-scavenger) by @blueman which was one of my favourites from LD39. Others have praised most of the things I like about Being Plundered so I won't repeat their words.\n\nI found that the best strategy is to rush out, mine an asteroid, and rush back to the station without ever interacting with the pirates at all. You can easily move faster than the pirates or their bullets so it's easiest to just never fight them :) plus you save money on repairing your ship. Early in the game I found it fun to fight the pirates (I've never seen this type of combat in a game before but I really like it) but in my pursuit of $100k it was just better to avoid them.\n\nI don't like that weird shaky effect on the background while mining, it's disorienting. I also wish that you could keep playing after reaching $100k. I was looking forward to mining every single asteroid in the whole map.\n\nSolid game, I'm really glad I played it :)","love":2,"love-timestamp":"2017-12-09T06:40:22Z","timestamp":"2017-12-6 23:25:35","ago":"4 years ago"},{"id":124806,"parent":0,"node":60803,"supernode":49883,"author":58592,"created":"2017-12-07T00:31:06Z","modified":"2017-12-07T00:31:06Z","version":140533,"flags":0,"body":"This would go very nicely with a perhaps more advanced ship building feature (kinda like nimbatus I am imagining here)","love":1,"love-timestamp":"2017-12-07T19:22:40Z","timestamp":"2017-12-7 2:31:06","ago":"4 years ago"},{"id":125495,"parent":0,"node":60803,"supernode":49883,"author":10321,"created":"2017-12-07T03:03:36Z","modified":"2017-12-07T03:03:36Z","version":141278,"flags":0,"body":"Nice game that fits the theme quite well.

Simply select the energy source again and choose some other turret.**\r\n- You can connect at most 2 energy sources per turret.\r\n- There are 4 different energy sources and they each produce an unique effect. Ice for example slows down enemies.\r\n- Combinations of the energy sources also provide unique combinations.\r\n- There is a wait time between each goblin wave. This can be skipped to gain a score multiplier for a time.\r\n- Hover over the tower icons to see what the currently connected energy sources do.\r\n- You may click & drag on the minimap to change the view.\r\n\r\n# Keys\r\n| Key | Action |\r\n| -------- | -------- |\r\n| Mouse pan | Pan the camera |\r\n| Mouse scroll | Zoom in / out |\r\n| Mouse left | Select / action |\r\n| Mouse right | Cancel selection / action |\r\n| Number keys 1-4 | Select energy source |\r\n| Esc / Q | Open pause menu |\r\n\r\n\r\n*Hectic defense*\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/YtxZj3L.png)\r\n\r\n*Fire and lightning*\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ZsKbpF7.png)","optouts":[],"rating_count":12,"results":{"all":[{"title":"Overall","result":6,"rating":"6.333"},{"title":"Graphics","result":6,"rating":"7.083"},{"title":"Audio","result":5,"rating":"6.667"},{"title":"Gameplay","result":7,"rating":"5.750"},{"title":"Originality","result":8,"rating":"6.583"},{"title":"Theme","result":8,"rating":"6.750"}],"overall":{"title":"Overall","result":6,"rating":"6.333"}},"comments":[{"id":7203,"user_id":223,"parent_id":null,"body":"That was not bad\r\n\r\nWith a few more days I think it could have been pretty nice, the small things I didn't like were the size of the map (especially when you can zoom out) or the fact that you can't link a crystal to multiple tower (I don't know if it's on purpose, but it's frustrating)\r\n\r\nSo anyway, could have been great, but it's \"just\" not bad","created_at":"2020-06-22T23:26:34.813Z","updated_at":"2020-06-22T23:26:34.836Z"},{"id":7227,"user_id":1518,"parent_id":null,"body":"Chill strategy game and nice music !

That's commendable, yet you are two people and, no, I don't give bonus points for effort, so here goes the usual. **Note end!**\r\n\r\nThe rooms keep getting bigger, but the challenge evaporates with fast boots and a *long range-multi-shot-no-sine-curve-nonsense* wand! I lucked out on the last one, granted, nonetheless the generator shouldn't produce such over powered devices given that the difficulty doesn't ramp up  at all.\r\n\r\nThe two ink blob types are not enough for 10 levels. Growing in number doesn't help with the power creep. The apprentices get new wands, however those might be of the rubbish *shoot-at-walls* variety, rendering them too a push over. This inverted challenge curve truly is the major issue here, ruining not only the theme, but also the most-important of all: the nebulous and fantabulous *fun*.\r\n\r\nBored become those who are to repeat without change the samiest of similarities with no end in sight. I lost count of the floors, that is. Maybe add a reminder?\r\n\r\nI could produce other small nitpicks as well, yet that would hardly matter. Let's end on the positives this time. The music is a proper fantasy fare, and the few sound effects are spot on. As pointed out by others, many expected sound effects are missing though, a curse of setting the bar so high. The visuals are fine in a similar way.\r\n\r\nActual bonus points for loot!

The visuals and audio are there, other aspects come a bit short.\r\n\r\nDefeating waves of enemies by moving about and lobbing projectiles is an old idea. Having a gate to protect and repair is a fine start, but should have been taken further. The tower could have its multiple floors targeted by different enemy types. If a floor is destroyed the player loses a benefit of some kind or the enemies receive a boost instead.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, having three floors increases the challenge on paper, but in practice movement is not needed as each enemy type can be attacked from the gate. If flying enemies could only be attacked from the top by making each projectile arc heavily (the upgrades ruin this at the moment) there would be an actual reason to climb up and down. Slower enemies, longer spell cooldowns and *one hit kill* projectiles would incentivize accuracy over spamming.\r\n\r\nIn short, utilizing the tower more would improve the latter ratings quite a lot.

I (we?) really appreciate it!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"https://alakajam.com/user/maartene\">@maartene</a>:\r\nI think there are three main reasons for our decision to leave out walking (apart from the obvious one: someone proposed it semi-jokingly and the others were like \"alright, let's do it!\")\r\n\r\n- Scope: I think the most important aspect in making a jam game is scoping properly. Removing the player's ability to walk around drastically reduced the features we needed to implement and the content we needed to create. We only had to care about the fixed points where the player can stand instead of every inch of every level.\r\n- Level design: We thought not allowing the player to walk around would let us to create interesting puzzles. All of the puzzles you see in the game are revolving around this idea of using the same resource (fire) to move around and burn down doors. So stripped down to very basics, the game is about managing your finite resources. I mean, it would be a totally different game with totally different puzzles if you could walk around. :) From the puzzle design point of view, it was both a blessing and a curse. On one hand, coming up with proper puzzles with such minimalistic mechanics was tricky. On the other hand, implementing the puzzles was very straightforward. So more drawing stuff on paper and less fooling around in the level editor.\r\n- Theme: Simply put, casting a spell to move fits the theme better than walking around.\r\n\r\nAlso, I think it's a cool gameplay mechanic that enables mouse-only controls. :)","created_at":"2019-02-27T07:41:25.112Z","updated_at":"2019-02-27T07:41:25.112Z"},{"id":5433,"user_id":896,"parent_id":null,"body":"@juutis thank you for your extensive explanation.

Amazing even, but VR titles have done first person teleportation to death due to necessity so one point reduced there.\r\n\r\nThematically strong.

Not that I can think of any suggestions at the moment... Hmm, I'll report back if anything comes up.\r\n\r\nThe puzzle mechanics are also great, but I'll drop one point due to bugs. A few times I could not retake a fire from a torch, and once the fire went through a wall. Both issues happened in the second to last level and forced a restart, *snap!*\r\n\r\nThe second to last level also took me the most time to solve as the last torch before the staircase is very hard to see. I'd suggest adding in a slight glow (or hud element) to each torch in view when holding a fireball. Looking for near invisible torches in the darkness isn't great user interface design when interactivity is about deductive logic, not pixel hunting or such.\r\n\r\nThe crosshair icon could change when targeting a door.

Could probably spare to use some more polygons in the ground geometry as well, some of those single polygons were the size of acres. Wasn't a huge fan of the camera work here either. Probably the best way would be twin stick control scheme where you could manually control the camera. Also some of those intro camera runs were borderline nausiating because of the fast twists and turns (and still on the same time took way too long) and really gave me zero idea about the layout of the level.\r\n\r\nThe second to last level was quite difficult. And took me that long to really figure out the whole mechanic behind the bigness meter. Until that point I just got to target house as fast as possible rolled around it in the snow until I was big enough while wondering why cows are indestructible while it only warned me about that one wall (hadn't even hit any trees at that point while being too small).

At that point, it's not really feasible for me to better map out exactly where the torso/head is -- I just have to try making small adjustments until it works.","created_at":"2018-02-26T16:26:25.956Z","updated_at":"2018-02-26T16:26:25.956Z"},{"id":1819,"user_id":330,"parent_id":null,"body":"This was a good *execution* of the theme. \r\n\r\nRiding the bullet was neat, I really enjoyed playing this.

Not exactly breaking new ground here, but the mixture of elements is well thought out. The levels themselves aren't very challenging due to the solution being linear and pretty much obvious every time.

The teleporter effect is very trippy indeed. The hard edge walls don't fit the otherwise organic looking aesthetic.  Animating the background, slowly squirming around, would have been ace!\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to juicyness I don't really feel it. The camera movement is smooth and the way it follows the projectile by zooming out *is* juicy, but otherwise there is little of it. The few particles look fine, you could have added a trail to the projectile and maybe a ghosting effect to the player ball too.\r\n\r\nI gotta say adding juice to a puzzle is tricky due to the limited amount of action.

The mechanic was well used in the various levels, and the difficulty reasonable throughout. Fun from start to finish. \r\n\r\nWhat has striken me most is the abstract, geometric atmosphere of the game, which worked mostly great! Both the art &amp; sound reminded me of the old [Kula World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ol1usmZs9r8) game... I wonder whether it has been an inspiration. The level transitions are awesome as well btw. Maybe the sole aspect of the art which broke the consistency was the walls, which would have worked better if they weren't so blocky (but I reckon doing otherwise would have required more time).\r\n\r\nA few small details:\r\n\r\n* I managed to &quot;cheat&quot; on level 2 by jumping directly to the exit. I actually managed to do it in two different ways: the first time by playing with shooting right after teleporting (it was a bit hard to do though), the second by simply shooting while hovering at the spawn.\r\n* Leaving the gravity of the spawn point without teleporting takes some patience\r\n* I don't know if it's intended but the ball cannot roll through single-tile large corridors. The ball could have been made slightly larger/smaller depending on the intent.\r\n\r\n### Juice\r\n\r\nFirst the work on camera movement is great, with my sole remark being that it could take in account the direction the ball is aiming at.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, while the game is not particularly generous in terms of effects, I still found the controls to be tight and satisfying, with the animated power bar &amp; the missile physics polished enough to make shooting fun.","created_at":"2017-11-22T21:30:01.194Z","updated_at":"2017-11-22T21:30:01.194Z"},{"id":1215,"user_id":36,"parent_id":null,"body":"Thanks for playing my game guys!\r\n\r\n@Wan it was cool that you noticed the &quot;shoot right after teleport&quot;-mechanic. I wanted that to be the main thing in the game but I didn't have enough time to make it satisfying enough, or to make levels that would teach it to the player.\r\n\r\nAlso, the the game  should have started off with levels without the teleporting projectile. The player could have moved by walking around and getting pulled in by some objects, perhaps hitting some switches... Let's say I would have liked to spend much more time on this than I did.\r\n","created_at":"2017-11-23T20:50:42.437Z","updated_at":"2017-11-23T20:50:42.437Z"},{"id":1227,"user_id":49,"parent_id":null,"body":"An interesting puzzle game! I enjoyed the concept (and the punny title) - it was an interesting take on teleportation mechanics, and the art was quite nice. \r\n\r\nWhen it comes to juiciness, the basic graphical effects worked out nicely, even if the wall art clashed a bit with the overall impression. I felt that the movement felt a bit too &quot;clunky&quot;, in that the combination of directional movement and elevation keys, space and enter-key did not feel entirely intuitive. Mouse aiming, in combination with mouse buttons triggering the two &quot;actions&quot; would have felt more natural I think.\r\n\r\nSome added particle effects in the disappearing and appearing locations when teleporting would give extra &quot;oomph&quot; to the teleportation core mechanic (perhaps combined with some kind of trail effect when rolling/falling).

On one hand I admire the upgrade system, enemies and general feel of the game, but on the other hand the camera movement is kind of dizzy and the health can't be replenished, which seriously hurts the game, as the difficulty is constantly being ramped up.\n\nOverall, good job!","created_at":"2021-03-02T20:06:00.000Z","updated_at":"2021-03-02T20:06:00.000Z"},{"id":8404,"user_id":56,"parent_id":null,"body":"Quick thoughts.\n\n*   I found it weird that the exit for each level is also where you came in, it doesn't really matter, just threw me off a bit.\n*   The skeleton knights don't really give much challenge, they are easy to kite around, so feel a bit redunant.\n*   The ranged enemies are also quite straightforward that just walking around the in circles slowly shooting them works well.\n*   The wall spell is an interesting idea but I didn't find much cause to use it, especially as it meant moving a finger of W to Q that messed up my circling tactic.\n*   Could have done with some more feedback when i took damage i sort of didn't notice quite a bit.\n*   I'm assuming the levels are procedural, but they currently don't do much for the gameplay giving big open areas I can use my circling technique in.\n*   I completely missed the levelling up component until I came back and reread the description.\n*   Visuals are ok, sort of look a little bit strange, part pixel art, but not really, but they are ok\n*   Really really liked the music (still letting it play now while i write the comments), but the sad relaxing feel is a bit of an odd choice for an action game.\n\nWell there you go, probably just tweaking the enemy speeds a bit and level layouts would do quite a lot for the gameplay.

Not only that - the game is easy to pick up and play, there's great visual feedback on what you do and the music fits the mood. So whatever is missing here is what could be added after a gamejam, because the time limit made it a necessity. I personally really don't like the art style (higher resolution pixel graphics) because it doesn't bring the charm of pixel art with it, while not reaching the fidelity of high resolution graphics. I'd move the game to either one direction or the other. I also feel like the graphics, while visually still pleasing, do announce \"I am a gamejam placeholder\" a bit too much. Some elements like the characters & scattered skeleton bones are more detailed, I like those.\r\n\r\nWell done!

I got to the level after, where I just got surrounded by mostly archers. It would have been nice to gain XP based on level instead of killing skeletons, since for speed it would encourage the player to try and run between the skeletons, rather than using a sort of tedious hit-and-run tactic. Good job on the game though, I like this genre and especially the limited vision was a nice touch for atmosphere and gameplay.\r\n\r\nEdit: phew, made it to level 14 - wish there was some way of replenishing health, it's so hard not to take any damage from the ambush at the start of the later levels. And I suggest you turn on high scores for this game with the level number reached as the score :-)","created_at":"2021-03-18T18:53:01.757Z","updated_at":"2021-03-18T19:04:22.482Z"}],"users":[{"id":36,"name":"bradur","title":"bradur","avatar":"/data/uploads/user/36.jpg","is_mod":null,"is_admin":null},{"id":327,"name":"Juutis","title":"Juutis","avatar":"/data/uploads/user/327.png","is_mod":null,"is_admin":null},{"id":35,"name":"M2tias","title":"M2tias","avatar":"/data/uploads/user/35.png","is_mod":null,"is_admin":null}],"path":"alakajam/11th-alakajam/zarguufs-bone-crypt-adventure","cover":"alakajam/11th-alakajam/zarguufs-bone-crypt-adventure/images/1075.png","coverColors":{"colors":[{"_rgb":[33,70,37,1]},{"_rgb":[230,211,135,1]},{"_rgb":[68,120,75,1]},{"_rgb":[138,137,140,1]},{"_rgb":[140,156,168,1]}],"css":"--one: rgba(33,70,37,1);--two: rgba(230,211,135,1);--three: rgba(68,120,75,1);--four: rgba(138,137,140,1);--five: rgba(140,156,168,1);"},"event":{"id":33,"name":"11th-alakajam","title":"11th Alakajam!","display_dates":"26-28 February 2021","display_theme":"Ancient Ruins","status":"closed","status_theme":"1411","status_entry":"open_unranked","status_results":"results","countdown_config":{"message":"Jam results are out!","link":"results","phrase":"jam ran 26-28 February 2021","enabled":false},"url":"https://alakajam.com/11th-alakajam"},"timestamp":"?","ago":"?","eventName":"11th Alakajam!","eventType":"Alakajam","theme":"Ancient Ruins"}]}]
