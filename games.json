Turning is way too slow and there is not enough friction. It's difficult enough to drive down a straight road; making a turn without veering off into the grass is basically impossible.\n\nI got through the first two levels with barely enough time left on the clock, but the third seemed like I had to know the map well to actually beat it, since there's branching paths that aren't all visible on the minimap.\n\nI really like the transition animation between the driving and the shooting.\n\nShooting didn't have much weight to it, I just had to locate and click on all the enemies. I wonder if a little bit of kickback on the player camera, or a more visceral death animation would help this section.\n\nI think the driving music was a bit too aggressive and sine-y and grated on me a little after a few levels. The shooting music tones down the frustrating bits so I enjoyed that a lot more. Oh, and it's rare to see a LD game with multiple music tracks so nice work there, and with the transition.\n\nOverall, this game feels like it just needed a lot more love put into its core mechanics (the driving and shooting models), maybe at the cost of the maps and objectives being less fleshed-out, or fewer levels. I know I've made the same mistake myself sometimes, prioritizing content without a good baseline mechanic. Maybe keep that in mind next LD.","love":1,"love-timestamp":"2018-05-12T04:26:53Z","timestamp":"5/11/2018, 22:51:35","ago":"2 years ago"}],"event":{"id":73256,"parent":9,"superparent":5,"author":11,"type":"event","subtype":"ld","subsubtype":"","published":"2018-03-15T01:50:26Z","created":"2018-03-15T01:50:26Z","modified":"2018-04-19T16:41:16Z","version":226293,"slug":"41","name":"Ludum Dare 41","body":"Join us for the **41st** Ludum Dare!

It reminds me of [Asteroid Scavenger](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/asteroid-scavenger) by @blueman which was one of my favourites from LD39. Others have praised most of the things I like about Being Plundered so I won't repeat their words.\n\nI found that the best strategy is to rush out, mine an asteroid, and rush back to the station without ever interacting with the pirates at all. You can easily move faster than the pirates or their bullets so it's easiest to just never fight them :) plus you save money on repairing your ship. Early in the game I found it fun to fight the pirates (I've never seen this type of combat in a game before but I really like it) but in my pursuit of $100k it was just better to avoid them.\n\nI don't like that weird shaky effect on the background while mining, it's disorienting. I also wish that you could keep playing after reaching $100k.

I think this is my favorite compo game so far. The turning is a bit fast which makes movement challenging and it gets pretty hard once a ton of ships start warping in. I thought it was based on amount you were hauling but I mined a small asteroid and 5+ ships still warped in. I guess its based on the largest asteroid you mined so you should probably go in size order?","love":1,"love-timestamp":"2017-12-09T06:40:20Z","timestamp":"12/8/2017, 09:28:06","ago":"2 years ago"},{"id":130540,"parent":0,"node":60803,"supernode":49883,"author":214,"created":"2017-12-08T07:52:30Z","modified":"2017-12-08T07:52:47Z","version":146861,"flags":0,"body":"@rasm Hey thanks for playing!
