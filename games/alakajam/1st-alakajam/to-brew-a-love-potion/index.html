Even the bandits didn't really challenge me, because they just got stuck behind their wall. But I like how you got several types of mobs in there, as well as quests and some funny <del>dia</del>monologue. Particularly the ending (kudos for <em>having</em> an ending!) made me smile :)</p> <p>Graphics are simple but consistent, and get the job done; I particularly liked the horrible amounts of blood coming from a single bunny. The music is alright, but does get repetitive quickly. Some sound effects would not gave gone amiss, but after having played some games with poorly made bfxr junk, I'm beginning to think that no sound effects can be preferable to that ;)</p> </div> </div><div class=game-comment><div class=game-comment-author>undefined</div> <div class=game-comment-created>undefined</div> <div class="svelte-fsh916 game-comment-body"><p>A competent yet middle of the road, top-down-shooter-fetch-quest.
