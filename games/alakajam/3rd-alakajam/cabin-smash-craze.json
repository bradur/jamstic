Until that point I just got to target house as fast as possible rolled around it in the snow until I was big enough while wondering why cows are indestructible while it only warned me about that one wall (hadn't even hit any trees at that point while being too small).

The graphics are basic and could do with something other than snow to break things up - and I'm not a big fan of the camera, though it mostly behaved itself - but the music is really good and so is the gameplay. You managed to pack in a decent amount of variety there in a very short amount of time, with each level having a new little twist to it. The second to last one in particular was very challenging, but a lot of fun to complete. I would have appreciated not having to skip the intro each time, or having the camera snap directly to its start position when the intro is skipped, given the amount of attempts it took me. The last level was a bit of a letdown after that - it would have been good to have it bring back all the concepts from the previous levels and tie them all together somehow.
