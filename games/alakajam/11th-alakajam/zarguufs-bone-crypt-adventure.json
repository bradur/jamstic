Not only that - the game is easy to pick up and play, there's great visual feedback on what you do and the music fits the mood. So whatever is missing here is what could be added after a gamejam, because the time limit made it a necessity. I personally really don't like the art style (higher resolution pixel graphics) because it doesn't bring the charm of pixel art with it, while not reaching the fidelity of high resolution graphics. I'd move the game to either one direction or the other. I also feel like the graphics, while visually still pleasing, do announce \"I am a gamejam placeholder\" a bit too much. Some elements like the characters & scattered skeleton bones are more detailed, I like those.\r\n\r\nWell done!
