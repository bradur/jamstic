Lots of interesting items with varied stats to make choosing them interesting. Variation in weapon particles was interesting. Enemies were simple, but stealing their different weapons was fun. Perhaps a few palette swaps or something would have been nice. Found it a little on the easy side, but then I play a lot of roguelike & bullet hell stuff, so it might be just me. Music was cute, but got a little repetitive after several floors. Didn't mesh to well with the gameplay - perhaps having a combat tune, or a layered piece of music that grew in complexity over each floor would be good. A mechanically complex and somwhat well polished piece of work with lots of content for the time period. Good job!</p> </div> </div><div class=game-comment><div class=game-comment-author>undefined</div> <div class=game-comment-created>undefined</div> <div class="svelte-1bt4eh4 game-comment-body"><p>Dungeon crawl! A perfect fit for the theme, if executed perfectly. Each floor darker than the last, filled with more menacing creatures‚Ä¶? Not here.</p> <p><strong>Note start!</strong> You managed to put in quite a lot of systems and content for a jam. That's commendable, yet you are two people and, no, I don't give bonus points for effort, so here goes the usual. <strong>Note end!</strong></p> <p>The rooms keep getting bigger, but the challenge evaporates with fast boots and a <em>long range-multi-shot-no-sine-curve-nonsense</em> wand! I lucked out on the last one, granted, nonetheless the generator shouldn't produce such over powered devices given that the difficulty doesn't ramp up at all.</p> <p>The two ink blob types are not enough for 10 levels. Growing in number doesn't help with the power creep. The apprentices get new wands, however those might be of the rubbish <em>shoot-at-walls</em> variety, rendering them too a push over. This inverted challenge curve truly is the major issue here, ruining not only the theme, but also the most-important of all: the nebulous and fantabulous <em>fun</em>.</p> <p>Bored become those who are to repeat without change the samiest of similarities with no end in sight. I lost count of the floors, that is. Maybe add a reminder?</p> <p>I could produce other small nitpicks as well, yet that would hardly matter. Let's end on the positives this time. The music is a proper fantasy fare, and the few sound effects are spot on. As pointed out by others, many expected sound effects are missing though, a curse of setting the bar so high. The visuals are fine in a similar way.</p> <p>Actual bonus points for loot! I long for the day when <em>loot</em> is to beat the themes to be.</p> <p>Solid work with shaky design.</p> <p>Overall: <em>Above Average (6.0)</em><br>Graphics: <em>Good (7.0)</em><br>Audio: <em>Good (7.0)</em><br>Gameplay: <em>Below Average (4.0)</em><br>Originality: <em>Below Average (4.0)</em><br>Theme: <em>Average (5.0)</em> </p> </div> </div><div class=game-comment><div class=game-comment-author>undefined</div> <div class=game-comment-created>undefined</div> <div class="svelte-1bt4eh4 game-comment-body"><p>This was quite fun: it's a pretty convention game design, and i didn't entirely understand the connection to thteme but it is well made a well balanced: I liked the variety of different game elements such as the powerups for firing capcbilities, speed, teleport etc. all very cool. The game is a little bit slow to start but by the time you get a few levels it starts to get exciting as the intensity of the action heats up a bit. The music was nice and relaxing, but I didn't really feel it was that well connected to the pace of the game: was expecting something a bit more exciting or with a hint of action in it.</p> </div> </div><div class=game-comment><div class=game-comment-author>undefined</div> <div class=game-comment-created>undefined</div> <div class="svelte-1bt4eh4 game-comment-body"><p>Had a lot more fun than I expected.
