For some reason the local goblins desperately want to stay in the same tower! Stop the goblins by powering up the nearby magic turrets with some crystal energy sources.\r\n\r\n# Important!\r\nWe recommend the Windows build - the WebGL build has some issues with mouse panning especially if you have multiple monitors.\r\n\r\n# How to play\r\n- Look at the minimap to see where goblins are coming from.\r\n- Select an energy source by pressing number keys 1-4 or by clicking.\r\n- Connect the energy source to a turret. The connection is not instant, the energy source will travel to the turret.\r\n- The turret will shoot at goblins within its range if it has an energy source connected.\r\n- **You can change the connection to another turret later on! Simply select the energy source again and choose some other turret.**\r\n- You can connect at most 2 energy sources per turret.\r\n- There are 4 different energy sources and they each produce an unique effect. Ice for example slows down enemies.\r\n- Combinations of the energy sources also provide unique combinations.\r\n- There is a wait time between each goblin wave. This can be skipped to gain a score multiplier for a time.\r\n- Hover over the tower icons to see what the currently connected energy sources do.\r\n- You may click & drag on the minimap to change the view.\r\n\r\n# Keys\r\n| Key | Action |\r\n| -------- | -------- |\r\n| Mouse pan | Pan the camera |\r\n| Mouse scroll | Zoom in / out |\r\n| Mouse left | Select / action |\r\n| Mouse right | Cancel selection / action |\r\n| Number keys 1-4 | Select energy source |\r\n| Esc / Q | Open pause menu |\r\n\r\n\r\n*Hectic defense*\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/YtxZj3L.png)\r\n\r\n*Fire and lightning*\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ZsKbpF7.png)","optouts":[],"rating_count":12,"results":{"all":[],"overall":{"title":"","result":null}},"comments":[{"id":7203,"user_id":223,"parent_id":null,"body":"That was not bad\r\n\r\nWith a few more days I think it could have been pretty nice, the small things I didn't like were the size of the map (especially when you can zoom out) or the fact that you can't link a crystal to multiple tower (I don't know if it's on purpose, but it's frustrating)\r\n\r\nSo anyway, could have been great, but it's \"just\" not bad","created_at":"2020-06-22T23:26:34.813Z","updated_at":"2020-06-22T23:26:34.836Z","html":"<p>That was not bad</p>\n<p>With a few more days I think it could have been pretty nice, the small things I didn&#39;t like were the size of the map (especially when you can zoom out) or the fact that you can&#39;t link a crystal to multiple tower (I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s on purpose, but it&#39;s frustrating)</p>\n<p>So anyway, could have been great, but it&#39;s &quot;just&quot; not bad</p>\n"},{"id":7227,"user_id":1518,"parent_id":null,"body":"Chill strategy game and nice music !
