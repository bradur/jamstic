The 3-part robot used to have a 1% red zone at the top, but we decided that it should never fail. I just removed the zone which left a 1% "nothing" there that restarts the process. You just probably managed to hit the top 1% multiple times :D</p> </div> </div><div class=game-comment><div class=game-comment-author>undefined</div> <div class=game-comment-created>undefined</div> <div class="svelte-1bt4eh4 game-comment-body"><p>Wow, great entry all round! Graphics immediately impress with the high quality sprites and visual effects. Everything looks consistent and atmospheric. Music is fitting if maybe a little on the cheerful side.</p> <p>As for gameplay, you nailed that as well, and that's coming from someone who does not like twin-stick shooters and is generally terrible at them. At the beginning, the spare parts around the base encourage you to venture out, and at this point you still have a chance to build some allies in relative peace. And you need some peace, what with the waiting time and power bar minigame. I love that there is an unlockable gun right there to entice you. The robots look varied in appearance, although I didn't really notice any difference in their behaviour.</p> <p>Unfortunately I didn't get far enough to unlock the bad-ass gun, but I feel that this is entirely due to my lack of skill and not because of any unfairness in the game. (The fact that full screen gives me about 5 fps whereas the non-full screen is tiny and hard to control might also play a role.)</p> </div> </div><div class=game-comment><div class=game-comment-author>undefined</div> <div class=game-comment-created>undefined</div> <div class="svelte-1bt4eh4 game-comment-body"><p>Felt very polished :)</p> </div> </div></div></div></div></div></main></div> <script>__SAPPER__={baseUrl:"/jamstic",preloaded:[void 0,null,(function(a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,l,m,n,o){return {game:{id:1153,event_id:d,event_name:e,name:f,title:f,description:"Kill robots.
