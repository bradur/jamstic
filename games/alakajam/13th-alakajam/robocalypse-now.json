The game had interesting mechanics, which could maybe be balanced a bit better (e.g. I felt the difficulty to be too gentle at first and then suddenly get impossible), but still provided a nice challenge. I tried multiple times but just always failed just shy of the 5k for the gun upgrade(?). The game is very dark, which is good for the scary atmosphere but bad when you get stuck on the somewhat low-contrast obstacles strewn about the map :) I felt my robots were a little bit useless, and especially when the enemy hordes are approaching trying to get one constructed is almost not even worth it. I think there were multiple cases where I was jumpstarting the top (3-part) robot and pressing space for the second time just â€¦ did nothing? Restarted the jumpstart attempt? I don't know if it was because I was pushed away or what. With games like these it is also super unforgiving to have hitscan (or even almost-hitscan) enemy bullets, because if at any point there is a critical mass of enemy robots that have line of vision, there is really nothing you can do to survive.
