I rarely felt that I have wasted the \"expedition of the day\", usually returning with either a clear objective (having spotted an upgrade in the distance), or a clear idea of new paths to pursue the next time.\n\nSpeaking of the items, I felt that their placement and effect was effective as well, serving as direct goals and rewards for exploring a specific set of paths. Both the \"get rid of new kinds of obstacles\" and \"increase travel range\" bonuses felt meaningful, in the sense that they gave a feeling of actual progress and enabling of future explorations.\n\nThe skill-progression felt well balanced, with plenty of opportunities to improve either skill as needed. Although it took me some time to realize that you could actually dodge in combat (in effect, trading the more bountiful energy stat to save precious health). The steady amount of \"walking-XP\" at the same time meant that the time never felt completely wasted, even when ending up in a dead end.\n\n\nPresentation-wise, I really enjoyed the graphics, and the background tune was nice as well.

I'd say the basic club weapon should maybe have some changes so I can win fights by skill instead of just trading damage for damage. \n\nAlso there was this pretty funny bug here - the enemies can push you outside of the level:\n\n![chrome_2019-05-05_00-06-39.png](ludum-dare\u002F44\u002Fpay-with-your-blood\u002Fimages\u002F249ec.png)",love:a,timestamp:"2019-5-5 9:26:54",ago:J},{id:363904,parent:a,node:V,supernode:Q,author:126840,created:fs,modified:fs,version:404591,flags:a,body:"I like the music.

Turning is way too slow and there is not enough friction. It's difficult enough to drive down a straight road; making a turn without veering off into the grass is basically impossible.\n\nI got through the first two levels with barely enough time left on the clock, but the third seemed like I had to know the map well to actually beat it, since there's branching paths that aren't all visible on the minimap.\n\nI really like the transition animation between the driving and the shooting.\n\nShooting didn't have much weight to it, I just had to locate and click on all the enemies. I wonder if a little bit of kickback on the player camera, or a more visceral death animation would help this section.\n\nI think the driving music was a bit too aggressive and sine-y and grated on me a little after a few levels. The shooting music tones down the frustrating bits so I enjoyed that a lot more. Oh, and it's rare to see a LD game with multiple music tracks so nice work there, and with the transition.\n\nOverall, this game feels like it just needed a lot more love put into its core mechanics (the driving and shooting models), maybe at the cost of the maps and objectives being less fleshed-out, or fewer levels. I know I've made the same mistake myself sometimes, prioritizing content without a good baseline mechanic.

Others have praised most of the things I like about Being Plundered so I won't repeat their words.\n\nI found that the best strategy is to rush out, mine an asteroid, and rush back to the station without ever interacting with the pirates at all. You can easily move faster than the pirates or their bullets so it's easiest to just never fight them :) plus you save money on repairing your ship. Early in the game I found it fun to fight the pirates (I've never seen this type of combat in a game before but I really like it) but in my pursuit of $100k it was just better to avoid them.\n\nI don't like that weird shaky effect on the background while mining, it's disorienting.

Ice for example slows down enemies.\r\n- Combinations of the energy sources also provide unique combinations.\r\n- There is a wait time between each goblin wave.

If a floor is destroyed the player loses a benefit of some kind or the enemies receive a boost instead.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, having three floors increases the challenge on paper, but in practice movement is not needed as each enemy type can be attacked from the gate.

Removing the player's ability to walk around drastically reduced the features we needed to implement and the content we needed to create. We only had to care about the fixed points where the player can stand instead of every inch of every level.\r\n- Level design: We thought not allowing the player to walk around would let us to create interesting puzzles. All of the puzzles you see in the game are revolving around this idea of using the same resource (fire) to move around and burn down doors. So stripped down to very basics, the game is about managing your finite resources. I mean, it would be a totally different game with totally different puzzles if you could walk around. :) From the puzzle design point of view, it was both a blessing and a curse. On one hand, coming up with proper puzzles with such minimalistic mechanics was tricky. On the other hand, implementing the puzzles was very straightforward. So more drawing stuff on paper and less fooling around in the level editor.\r\n- Theme: Simply put, casting a spell to move fits the theme better than walking around.\r\n\r\nAlso, I think it's a cool gameplay mechanic that enables mouse-only controls. :)",created_at:kb,updated_at:kb},{id:5433,user_id:dt,parent_id:b,body:"@juutis thank you for your extensive explanation.

Amazing even, but VR titles have done first person teleportation to death due to necessity so one point reduced there.\r\n\r\nThematically strong. Spellcasting is used for everything yet it feels to me like something is missing. The enviroment isn't very magical and doesn't affect the spellcasting at all. Not that I can think of any suggestions at the moment... Hmm, I'll report back if anything comes up.\r\n\r\nThe puzzle mechanics are also great, but I'll drop one point due to bugs. A few times I could not retake a fire from a torch, and once the fire went through a wall. Both issues happened in the second to last level and forced a restart, *snap!*\r\n\r\nThe second to last level also took me the most time to solve as the last torch before the staircase is very hard to see. I'd suggest adding in a slight glow (or hud element) to each torch in view when holding a fireball. Looking for near invisible torches in the darkness isn't great user interface design when interactivity is about deductive logic, not pixel hunting or such.\r\n\r\nThe crosshair icon could change when targeting a door. I did accidentally burn a few doors when trying to light a torch instead.\r\n\r\nGreatness once again in the graphics department. Similarly to the themematic rating, the environment lacks little something something.. colorful? Tapestries on the walls, maybe?

Could probably spare to use some more polygons in the ground geometry as well, some of those single polygons were the size of acres. Wasn't a huge fan of the camera work here either. Probably the best way would be twin stick control scheme where you could manually control the camera. Also some of those intro camera runs were borderline nausiating because of the fast twists and turns (and still on the same time took way too long) and really gave me zero idea about the layout of the level.\r\n\r\nThe second to last level was quite difficult. And took me that long to really figure out the whole mechanic behind the bigness meter. Until that point I just got to target house as fast as possible rolled around it in the snow until I was big enough while wondering why cows are indestructible while it only warned me about that one wall (hadn't even hit any trees at that point while being too small).

The mechanic was well used in the various levels, and the difficulty reasonable throughout. Fun from start to finish. \r\n\r\nWhat has striken me most is the abstract, geometric atmosphere of the game, which worked mostly great! Both the art &amp; sound reminded me of the old [Kula World](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=Ol1usmZs9r8) game... I wonder whether it has been an inspiration. The level transitions are awesome as well btw. Maybe the sole aspect of the art which broke the consistency was the walls, which would have worked better if they weren't so blocky (but I reckon doing otherwise would have required more time).\r\n\r\nA few small details:\r\n\r\n* I managed to &quot;cheat&quot; on level 2 by jumping directly to the exit. I actually managed to do it in two different ways: the first time by playing with shooting right after teleporting (it was a bit hard to do though), the second by simply shooting while hovering at the spawn.\r\n* Leaving the gravity of the spawn point without teleporting takes some patience\r\n* I don't know if it's intended but the ball cannot roll through single-tile large corridors. The ball could have been made slightly larger\u002Fsmaller depending on the intent.\r\n\r\n### Juice\r\n\r\nFirst the work on camera movement is great, with my sole remark being that it could take in account the direction the ball is aiming at.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, while the game is not particularly generous in terms of effects, I still found the controls to be tight and satisfying, with the animated power bar &amp; the missile physics polished enough to make shooting fun.",created_at:lF,updated_at:lF},{id:1215,user_id:F,parent_id:b,body:"Thanks for playing my game guys!\r\n\r\n@Wan it was cool that you noticed the &quot;shoot right after teleport&quot;-mechanic.

The player could have moved by walking around and getting pulled in by some objects, perhaps hitting some switches...

I felt that the movement felt a bit too &quot;clunky&quot;, in that the combination of directional movement and elevation keys, space and enter-key did not feel entirely intuitive. Mouse aiming, in combination with mouse buttons triggering the two &quot;actions&quot; would have felt more natural I think.\r\n\r\nSome added particle effects in the disappearing and appearing locations when teleporting would give extra &quot;oomph&quot; to the teleportation core mechanic (perhaps combined with some kind of trail effect when rolling\u002Ffalling).

So whatever is missing here is what could be added after a gamejam, because the time limit made it a necessity. I personally really don't like the art style (higher resolution pixel graphics) because it doesn't bring the charm of pixel art with it, while not reaching the fidelity of high resolution graphics. I'd move the game to either one direction or the other. I also feel like the graphics, while visually still pleasing, do announce \"I am a gamejam placeholder\" a bit too much. Some elements like the characters & scattered skeleton bones are more detailed, I like those.\r\n\r\nWell done!

I got to the level after, where I just got surrounded by mostly archers. It would have been nice to gain XP based on level instead of killing skeletons, since for speed it would encourage the player to try and run between the skeletons, rather than using a sort of tedious hit-and-run tactic. Good job on the game though, I like this genre and especially the limited vision was a nice touch for atmosphere and gameplay.\r\n\r\nEdit: phew, made it to level 14 - wish there was some way of replenishing health, it's so hard not to take any damage from the ambush at the start of the later levels.
