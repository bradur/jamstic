I don't think you need a minimap or a better camera - there was only one place where I couldn't see what I needed (bottom of the last level). I'm not great at designing puzzles and you've already got some great levels in here. I'm stumped! Is there anything you wish you could have done that I could take a stab at?

Turning is way too slow and there is not enough friction. It's difficult enough to drive down a straight road; making a turn without veering off into the grass is basically impossible.\n\nI got through the first two levels with barely enough time left on the clock, but the third seemed like I had to know the map well to actually beat it, since there's branching paths that aren't all visible on the minimap.\n\nI really like the transition animation between the driving and the shooting.\n\nShooting didn't have much weight to it, I just had to locate and click on all the enemies. I wonder if a little bit of kickback on the player camera, or a more visceral death animation would help this section.\n\nI think the driving music was a bit too aggressive and sine-y and grated on me a little after a few levels. The shooting music tones down the frustrating bits so I enjoyed that a lot more. Oh, and it's rare to see a LD game with multiple music tracks so nice work there, and with the transition.\n\nOverall, this game feels like it just needed a lot more love put into its core mechanics (the driving and shooting models), maybe at the cost of the maps and objectives being less fleshed-out, or fewer levels. I know I've made the same mistake myself sometimes, prioritizing content without a good baseline mechanic.

Ice for example slows down enemies.\r\n- Combinations of the energy sources also provide unique combinations.\r\n- There is a wait time between each goblin wave.

I (we?) really appreciate it!\r\n\r\n\u003Ca href=\"https:\u002F\u002Falakajam.com\u002Fuser\u002Fmaartene\"\u003E@maartene\u003C\u002Fa\u003E:\r\nI think there are three main reasons for our decision to leave out walking (apart from the obvious one: someone proposed it semi-jokingly and the others were like \"alright, let's do it!\")\r\n\r\n- Scope: I think the most important aspect in making a jam game is scoping properly. Removing the player's ability to walk around drastically reduced the features we needed to implement and the content we needed to create. We only had to care about the fixed points where the player can stand instead of every inch of every level.\r\n- Level design: We thought not allowing the player to walk around would let us to create interesting puzzles. All of the puzzles you see in the game are revolving around this idea of using the same resource (fire) to move around and burn down doors. So stripped down to very basics, the game is about managing your finite resources. I mean, it would be a totally different game with totally different puzzles if you could walk around. :) From the puzzle design point of view, it was both a blessing and a curse. On one hand, coming up with proper puzzles with such minimalistic mechanics was tricky. On the other hand, implementing the puzzles was very straightforward. So more drawing stuff on paper and less fooling around in the level editor.\r\n- Theme: Simply put, casting a spell to move fits the theme better than walking around.\r\n\r\nAlso, I think it's a cool gameplay mechanic that enables mouse-only controls. :)",created_at:if_,updated_at:if_},{id:5168,user_id:1110,parent_id:b,body:"Nice puzzles, realy liked it",created_at:ig,updated_at:ig},{id:5352,user_id:363,parent_id:b,body:"This one puzzled me for a while.

The animation, effects and sfx are a bit unequal.\r\nThe warp could be improved visually, especially since it's the action you do the most in the game. Its sfx could be reworked too, it kinda sounded like a digital fart which was a bit unsettling.\r\nWhereas the fireball and finger snap look, sound and feel very good. \r\n\r\nThe music is nice and although it gets a bit repetitive it remains enjoyable.\r\n\r\nI don't have much more to say because overall the game works really well and feels pretty polished.",created_at:ij,updated_at:ij},{id:5453,user_id:573,parent_id:b,body:"MY LEGS!!\r\n\r\nThis is one of my favorites on this jam.

Amazing even, but VR titles have done first person teleportation to death due to necessity so one point reduced there.\r\n\r\nThematically strong. Spellcasting is used for everything yet it feels to me like something is missing. The enviroment isn't very magical and doesn't affect the spellcasting at all. Not that I can think of any suggestions at the moment... Hmm, I'll report back if anything comes up.\r\n\r\nThe puzzle mechanics are also great, but I'll drop one point due to bugs. A few times I could not retake a fire from a torch, and once the fire went through a wall. Both issues happened in the second to last level and forced a restart, *snap!*\r\n\r\nThe second to last level also took me the most time to solve as the last torch before the staircase is very hard to see. I'd suggest adding in a slight glow (or hud element) to each torch in view when holding a fireball. Looking for near invisible torches in the darkness isn't great user interface design when interactivity is about deductive logic, not pixel hunting or such.\r\n\r\nThe crosshair icon could change when targeting a door. I did accidentally burn a few doors when trying to light a torch instead.\r\n\r\nGreatness once again in the graphics department. Similarly to the themematic rating, the environment lacks little something something.. colorful? Tapestries on the walls, maybe?

From playing Talos, I realize level design is not easy with this sort of 3D puzzles. Removing the ability to walk was a bold idea that 100% paid off, both for pure gameplay and for making it easier to design levels. The only issue I had was that the instant teleportation could be disorienting at times: making the camera quickly slide to the target instead would have helped.\r\n\r\nGraphics and sound are also a great strength here, with the character model and animations in particular being top notch (nice finger snap :P). This all gives a good atmosphere, with my only wish being for the levels to look less repetitive. Dropping random models around, like skeletons or furniture would have been nice, but more importantly the similar texture between walls and floor make things feel a bit prototypey.

Probably the best way would be twin stick control scheme where you could manually control the camera.

The mechanic was well used in the various levels, and the difficulty reasonable throughout.

Both the art &amp; sound reminded me of the old [Kula World](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fwatch?v=Ol1usmZs9r8) game... I wonder whether it has been an inspiration. The level transitions are awesome as well btw. Maybe the sole aspect of the art which broke the consistency was the walls, which would have worked better if they weren't so blocky (but I reckon doing otherwise would have required more time).\r\n\r\nA few small details:\r\n\r\n* I managed to &quot;cheat&quot; on level 2 by jumping directly to the exit. I actually managed to do it in two different ways: the first time by playing with shooting right after teleporting (it was a bit hard to do though), the second by simply shooting while hovering at the spawn.\r\n* Leaving the gravity of the spawn point without teleporting takes some patience\r\n* I don't know if it's intended but the ball cannot roll through single-tile large corridors. The ball could have been made slightly larger\u002Fsmaller depending on the intent.\r\n\r\n### Juice\r\n\r\nFirst the work on camera movement is great, with my sole remark being that it could take in account the direction the ball is aiming at.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, while the game is not particularly generous in terms of effects, I still found the controls to be tight and satisfying, with the animated power bar &amp; the missile physics polished enough to make shooting fun.",created_at:jS,updated_at:jS},{id:1227,user_id:bm,parent_id:b,body:"An interesting puzzle game!

Mouse aiming, in combination with mouse buttons triggering the two &quot;actions&quot; would have felt more natural I think.\r\n\r\nSome added particle effects in the disappearing and appearing locations when teleporting would give extra &quot;oomph&quot; to the teleportation core mechanic (perhaps combined with some kind of trail effect when rolling\u002Ffalling). I loved the level transitions and overall camera direction, they both worked really well.\r\n\r\n\u003E The portals beckon.\r\n\u003E With good aim, and great patience,\r\n\u003E escape is certain.",created_at:jT,updated_at:jT},{id:1200,user_id:af,parent_id:b,body:"A solid physics based puzzle! Not exactly breaking new ground here, but the mixture of elements is well thought out. The levels themselves aren't very challenging due to the solution being linear and pretty much obvious every time. Adding in more mechanics and elements in each level to force the player to think through multiple paths would have helped.\r\n\r\nI would have preferred mouse control for the aiming, keyboard works ok enough.\r\n\r\nThe graphics are nice. The teleporter effect is very trippy indeed. The hard edge walls don't fit the otherwise organic looking aesthetic.  Animating the background, slowly squirming around, would have been ace!\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to juicyness I don't really feel it. The camera movement is smooth and the way it follows the projectile by zooming out *is* juicy, but otherwise there is little of it. The few particles look fine, you could have added a trail to the projectile and maybe a ghosting effect to the player ball too.\r\n\r\nI gotta say adding juice to a puzzle is tricky due to the limited amount of action.
