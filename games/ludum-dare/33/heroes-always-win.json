The item placement is a little wonky, but should work fine unless you intentionally try to break it. Pathfinding should work most of the time, but I'm sure it has problems here and there. Most of the levels are pretty easy since I didn't have enough time to do any serious level design.\n\nTools & resources used:\n\n- Unity3D\n- Sublime Text 3\n- Visual Studio 2013 Community Edition\n- LMMS (music)\n- Bfxr (the two sound effects)\n- Paint.NET\n- Tiled (map editor)\n- TiledSharp (Tiled map format -> C# library)\n- OBS (streaming, video recording)\n\n\nI built the game for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux, but have only tested it on Windows. Should work with any screen over 1280x720. Designed for 16:9 aspect ratio. Works with other aspect ratios as well, but the UI gets a little messy.","links":[{"title":"Windows","url":"https://github.com/bradur/LD33/releases/download/v1.0/windows.zip"},{"title":"OS/X","url":"https://github.com/bradur/LD33/releases/download/v1.0/mac.zip"},{"title":"Linux","url":"https://github.com/bradur/LD33/releases/download/v1.0/linux.zip"},{"title":"Source","url":"https://github.com/bradur/LD33"},{"title":"Ludum Dare entry page","url":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-33/?action=preview&uid=40138"}],"results":{"all":[{"result":"http://ludumdare.com/compo/wp-content/plugins/compo2/images/ibronze.gif","title":"Coolness","average":"64%"},{"result":"83","title":"Innovation","average":"3.74"},{"result":"176","title":"Fun","average":"3.49"},{"result":"206","title":"Overall","average":"3.49"},{"result":"222","title":"Audio","average":"3.24"},{"result":"426","title":"Theme","average":"3.46"},{"result":"570","title":"Humor","average":"2.46"},{"result":"698","title":"Mood","average":"2.61"},{"result":"748","title":"Graphics","average":"2.51"}],"overall":{"result":"206","title":"Overall","average":"3.49"}},"url":"games/ludum-dare/33/heroes-always-win","coverColors":{"colors":[{"_rgb":[118,126,96,1]},{"_rgb":[205,218,183,1]},{"_rgb":[58,59,49,1]},{"_rgb":[193,180,134,1]},{"_rgb":[186,186,182,1]}],"css":"--one: rgba(118,126,96,1);--two: rgba(205,218,183,1);--three: rgba(58,59,49,1);--four: rgba(193,180,134,1);--five: rgba(186,186,182,1);"},"comments":[],"html":"<p>Heroes Always Win</p>\n<p>Slow down the Hero&#39;s journey through your master&#39;s fortress!</p>\n<p>Plot &amp; design:\n<a href='http://ludumdare.com/compo/2015/08/22/heroes-always-win/' title='null'>http://ludumdare.com/compo/2015/08/22/heroes-always-win/</a> (original plan)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Place minions and gold on the floor.</li>\n<li>The Hero will collect all the gold before heading for the exit.</li>\n<li>The Hero will fight (and kill) the minions that block the Hero&#39;s path.</li>\n<li>You must be able to slow down the hero so that you may escape deeper into the fortress (the time varies between levels).</li>\n<li>Once you press Start, the Hero starts moving through the level.</li>\n<li>You can zoom in / out and pan the camera using mouse &amp; arrow keys.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This game had lots of difficult things to implement, so there will be plenty of bugs.
