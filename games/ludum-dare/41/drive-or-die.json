Turning is way too slow and there is not enough friction. It's difficult enough to drive down a straight road; making a turn without veering off into the grass is basically impossible.\n\nI got through the first two levels with barely enough time left on the clock, but the third seemed like I had to know the map well to actually beat it, since there's branching paths that aren't all visible on the minimap.\n\nI really like the transition animation between the driving and the shooting.\n\nShooting didn't have much weight to it, I just had to locate and click on all the enemies. I wonder if a little bit of kickback on the player camera, or a more visceral death animation would help this section.\n\nI think the driving music was a bit too aggressive and sine-y and grated on me a little after a few levels. The shooting music tones down the frustrating bits so I enjoyed that a lot more. Oh, and it's rare to see a LD game with multiple music tracks so nice work there, and with the transition.\n\nOverall, this game feels like it just needed a lot more love put into its core mechanics (the driving and shooting models), maybe at the cost of the maps and objectives being less fleshed-out, or fewer levels. I know I've made the same mistake myself sometimes, prioritizing content without a good baseline mechanic. Maybe keep that in mind next LD.","love":1,"love-timestamp":"2018-05-12T04:26:53Z","timestamp":"2018-5-11 22:51:35","ago":"2 years ago","html":"<p>As others have said, the driving model in this game really breaks it.
