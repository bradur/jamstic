I like the art and the sound design and music. I found the controls a bit counter-intuitive (which is a problem everyone had with my game, too). It was quite hard to aim at the fish, in my opinion, and a little bit of magnetism to pick up the gold would have been a nice improvement. Overall, though, this was a great entry. Good work!</p> </div> </div><div class=game-comment><div class=game-comment-author>172599</div> <div class=game-comment-created title="2021-4-29 19:30:32">9 months ago</div> <div class="svelte-1bt4eh4 game-comment-body"><p>Very cool! It was a pleasure to explore in my little submarine. Although, with the amount of reckless driving I've been doing, I'm not surprised that people started to be scared to buy my services... even without the interference of a certain heart :laughing: </p> <p>The graphics are nice and the sfx are great! I bought all the upgrades and even had 19 bucks leftover. It is a really great jam game - held my interest and worked perfectly.</p> <p>The only issue I had was with the controls at the beginning. I could not use my mouse to aim (as the keybindings would suggest I should). Aim was fixed in place and all I could do was turn my little submarine. That changed after I bought one of the torpedo upgrades - I started to be able to aim with my mouse. I'm not sure if it's a bug or by design. But if it's by design, you should mention it in keybindings to avoid player confusion.</p> <p>Anyway, let me repeat my initial statement: very cool :).</p> </div> </div><div class=game-comment><div class=game-comment-author>171993</div> <div class=game-comment-created title="2021-4-30 2:17:59">9 months ago</div> <div class="svelte-1bt4eh4 game-comment-body"><p>Such a neat game. I loved the movement and being able to jump a bit out of the water, although I do wish it was easier to aim the sub's weapon. Music and visuals were very pleasant and calming.

It controls real well, the shooting is fun, and the upgrades are cool! The only thing I can even think to really improve is upgrade pace. The boxes there helped with the upgrades, but if you died right when you got some, it made the upgrade time longer, causing me to repeat the level loop several times.

Glad you enjoyed our game!</p> <p>I see a lot of comments about aiming of the torpedoes. I do agree that aiming without the upgrade is clunky and hard. Maybe the "homing effect" shouldn't be on/off like it is now, but rather the torpedoes should always home in on the mouse cursor and the effectiveness of the homing could be upgraded. :thinking: </p> <p>@fabula-rasa the aiming mechanic is by design. You make an excellent point! I added a note about the mouse aiming to the key bindings.</p> <p>@drgrognak never played Operation Neptune.
