Here it is 19 years later. :smile:\n\nThis event will be a regular Jam/Compo combo event. Because of the significance, we want to encourage folks consider the **Compo**. See [the rules](/events/ludum-dare/rules). In the future we will be looking to streamline how events are run, but for the sake of the Compo's legacy, it was important the 48th event followed the classic rules.\n\nFollow the **[/news](/news)** for the latest updates on the event.\n\n* :closed_book: **Rules**: [/ludum-dare/rules](/events/ludum-dare/rules)\n* :green_book: **Game Hosting Guide**: [/ludum-dare/hosting-guide](/events/ludum-dare/hosting-guide)\n* :ballot_box: **Themes**: [/48/theme](/events/ludum-dare/48/theme)\n* :tv: **Keynote**: [A Q&A with Mike](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/48/$233336/welcome-to-ludum-dare-48)\n* :gift: **Deals and Promos**: [/48/.../ludum-deals](/events/ludum-dare/48/$233336/ludum-deals-48)","meta":{"can-grade":"0","can-publish":"0","can-theme":"1","event-finished":"1","event-theme":"Deeper and deeper","theme-mode":"8","theme-idea-limit":"3","event-start":"2021-04-24T01:00:00Z","event-end":"2021-04-27T01:00:00Z","theme-page-mode-1":"2","theme-page-mode-2":"2","theme-page-mode-3":"2","theme-page-mode-4":"2","theme-page-name-4":"Final Round","event-group-slug-1":"jam","event-group-name-1":"Jam","event-group-closed-1":"0","event-group-slug-2":"compo","event-group-name-2":"Compo","event-group-closed-2":"0","grade-01":"Overall","grade-02":"Fun","grade-03":"Innovation","grade-04":"Theme","grade-05":"Graphics","grade-05-optional":"1","grade-06":"Audio","grade-06-optional":"1","grade-07":"Humor","grade-07-optional":"1","grade-08":"Mood","grade-08-optional":"1"},"path":"/events/ludum-dare/48","parents":[1,5,9],"love":0,"timestamp":"2021-2-8 21:23:06","ago":"5 months ago"},"results":{"all":[{"title":"Overall","average":4.25,"result":55},{"title":"Fun","average":3.979,"result":167},{"title":"Innovation","average":3.542,"result":543},{"title":"Theme","average":4.188,"result":180},{"title":"Graphics","average":4.188,"result":332},{"title":"Audio","average":3.979,"result":200},{"title":"Humor","average":2.977,"result":668},{"title":"Mood","average":4.146,"result":192}],"overall":{"title":"Overall","average":4.25,"result":55}},"eventName":"Ludum Dare 48","url":"games/ludum-dare/48/sunk-cost","links":[{"url":"https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/48/sunk-cost","title":"LDJam page"},{"url":"https://github.com/Juutis/LD48","title":"Source Code"},{"url":"https://juutis.github.io/LD48/","title":"HTML5 (web)"}],"eventType":"LDJam","theme":"","html":"<h1 id=\"sunk-cost\">Sunk Cost</h1>\n<p>You are a small-time submarine entrepreneur.
