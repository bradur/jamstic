It reminds me of <a href=https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/39/asteroid-scavenger>Asteroid Scavenger</a> by @blueman which was one of my favourites from LD39. Others have praised most of the things I like about Being Plundered so I won't repeat their words.</p> <p>I found that the best strategy is to rush out, mine an asteroid, and rush back to the station without ever interacting with the pirates at all. You can easily move faster than the pirates or their bullets so it's easiest to just never fight them :) plus you save money on repairing your ship. Early in the game I found it fun to fight the pirates (I've never seen this type of combat in a game before but I really like it) but in my pursuit of $100k it was just better to avoid them.</p> <p>I don't like that weird shaky effect on the background while mining, it's disorienting. I also wish that you could keep playing after reaching $100k. I was looking forward to mining every single asteroid in the whole map.</p> <p>Solid game, I'm really glad I played it :)</p> </div> </div><div class=game-comment><div class=game-comment-author>58592</div> <div class=game-comment-created title="12/7/2017, 02:31:06">2 years ago</div> <div class="svelte-16bmbtx game-comment-body"><p>This would go very nicely with a perhaps more advanced ship building feature (kinda like nimbatus I am imagining here)</p> </div> </div><div class=game-comment><div class=game-comment-author>10321</div> <div class=game-comment-created title="12/7/2017, 05:03:36">2 years ago</div> <div class="svelte-16bmbtx game-comment-body"><p>Nice game that fits the theme quite well.

I think this is my favorite compo game so far. The turning is a bit fast which makes movement challenging and it gets pretty hard once a ton of ships start warping in. I thought it was based on amount you were hauling but I mined a small asteroid and 5+ ships still warped in. I guess its based on the largest asteroid you mined so you should probably go in size order?</p> </div> </div><div class=game-comment><div class=game-comment-author>214</div> <div class=game-comment-created title="12/8/2017, 09:52:30">2 years ago</div> <div class="svelte-16bmbtx game-comment-body"><p>@rasm Hey thanks for playing! The amount of pirates is based on the amount of money you have & the amount of ore you have & the amount of ore you are getting from the asteroid. So if you have 10k money and 5 ore and you mine an asteroid worth of 5, you get (10 + 5 + 5 / 10) = 2 pirates.</p> </div> </div><div class=game-comment><div class=game-comment-author>53524</div> <div class=game-comment-created title="12/8/2017, 09:58:46">2 years ago</div> <div class="svelte-16bmbtx game-comment-body"><p>Very nice game!
