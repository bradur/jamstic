As the city gains more citizens, the need for electricity grows steadily. Will you be able to provide for the city, or will you run out of power and become a disappointment? See if you can help the city grow to a population of **one hundred citizens**!\n\n![2017-07-31 02_56_57-Greenshot (Custom) (2).png](ludum-dare/39/in-charge-of-power/images/5e1b.png)\n\n*How to play*\n1. Use your mouse to hover over things and perhaps click some of those things.\n2. The game should be able to tell you which things are worth clicking.\n3.
