After the fifth loop it dawned on me how grindy it would be. </p> <p>=Scope= If the game had been just a bit less grindy, the big map would have been a big plus. I assume you're supposed to grind in the lower-level areas some more so you can exhaust yourself faster instead of walking for miles and dying for few XP, so the big map is wasted on the loops.</p> <p>=Graphics= For a game about exploration, it probably wouldn't have hurt to de-saturate the trees, make the grass a bit more varied, and have some transitions between the tiles, but I guess making a Wang tileset could easily have meant 20x as many tiles.</p> <p>=Audio= Nice and relaxing ambiance.</p> <p>Overall, okay game, ambitious scope, very grindy.</p> </div> </div><div class=game-comment><div class=game-comment-author>11376</div> <div class=game-comment-created title="2020-10-7 21:41:13">a year ago</div> <div class="svelte-1bt4eh4 game-comment-body"><p>The constant ticking down with every movment had me feeling anxious at first, but after repeated rest and getting more of the world opened up, it became a bit more enjoyable.

It's not the most original idea, but to be completely honest, I did the same interpretation, so I can't fault you for that. I felt like the game got off to a slow start, although with the speed upgrades it got better. The music was pretty chill and fitting. The graphics (especially the environment) were quite basic, but they did their job. Although I did get stuck for a little bit after I got the purple boots, I managed to complete my games within 21 loops. Overall it was a pretty enjoyable game and I'm glad I played it!</p> </div> </div></div></div></div></div></main></div> <script>__SAPPER__={baseUrl:"/jamstic",preloaded:[void 0,null,(function(a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i,j,k,l,m,n,o,p,q,r,s,t,u,v,w,x,y,z,A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,R,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z,_,$,aa,ab,ac,ad,ae,af,ag,ah,ai,aj){return {game:{id:d,parent:b,superparent:i,author:s,type:"item",subtype:"game",subsubtype:t,published:u,created:"2020-10-02T14:32:30Z",modified:u,version:676498,slug:"tranquil-grove",name:"Tranquil Grove",body:"# Story\nYou went camping.
