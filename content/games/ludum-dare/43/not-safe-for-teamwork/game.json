The last level really had me stumped for a while (I almost thought maybe you'd accidentally made the game unbeatable for a good 5 minutes or so)! That music just goes so well with the theme of the game, and the theme of the game goes so well with the theme of the jam.\n\nI'm playing this because you submitted it to be a part of my Play & Improve series, but I'm honestly having difficulty thinking of what I'd even do. The only usability problem that bugged me was that I had to press 'P' before 'R' to restart! Other than that, it's really the graphics that need the most improvement and I'm a terrible artist. I don't think you need a minimap or a better camera - there was only one place where I couldn't see what I needed (bottom of the last level). I'm not great at designing puzzles and you've already got some great levels in here. I'm stumped! Is there anything you wish you could have done that I could take a stab at?
