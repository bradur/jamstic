    "body": "![flippers.png](ludum-dare/38/out-of-this-small-world/images/8f1.png)\n\n**Out of This Small World** is a puzzle game, where you're on a small planet.\nYou must use the curvature of the planet to your advantage! (hint: the map loops on itself).\nStep through the portal and get Out of This Small World (just to find another one behind the portal).\n\n## Download:\n* **Windows:** https://github.com/bradur/LD38/releases/download/1.0/OutofThisSmallWorld_win.zip\n* **Max OSX:** https://github.com/bradur/LD38/releases/download/1.0/OutofThisSmallWorld_mac.zip\n* **Linux:** https://github.com/bradur/LD38/releases/download/1.0/OutofThisSmallWorld_linux.zip\n\n*Only the Windows version has been tested*\n\n*Meant to be run at a 16:9 resolution*\n\n## Keys:\n\n- Arrow Keys: Move\n- Esc: Open menu\n- (hold) Right Shift: Sprint while moving forward\n- Space: Chop tree (when equipped with an axe and targeting a tree)\n- Right Ctrl: Unlock a door (when equipped with a key and targeting a door)\n- F1: Toggle info\n- P: Mute audio\n\n## Tips:\n\n- Some switches only work once, some work endlessly\n- Axes are poorly made. They can only withstand chopping down one tree before they break!\n- If you have flippers you can walk on water (no time to implement swimming animation!).\n\n## Bugs:\n\n- The looping world was implemented very poorly. Bugs related to that are bound to happen.\n- Sometimes a tree just won't go down. Restarting the level should do the trick! (Esc and Q).\n\n## More screenshots\n![yellowkey.png](ludum-dare/38/out-of-this-small-world/images/8ed.png)\n![screen_1492988936.05.png](ludum-dare/38/out-of-this-small-world/images/8ea.png)\n\n## Links\n* **TWITTER:** https://twitter.com/bradurdung\n* **SOURCE CODE:** https://github.com/bradur/LD38",
